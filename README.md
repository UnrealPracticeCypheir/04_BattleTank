# BattleTankz


## Open-world head-to-head tank fight with simple AI, terrain, and advanced control system in Unreal 4.

### Concept:
* Tank battle is an open-world head-to-head tank combat game.
* The terrain will be used for tactical advantage.
* The focus will be on flow and feel.


### Rules:
* You can move anywhere in the terrain, which is surrounded by mountains.
* Both players start with finite health and ammo.
* Each direct hit takes away health.
* The last player standing wins.

### Requirements:
* SFX: Gun firing, explosion, barrel moving, turret moving, engine sound.
* Static Mesh: Simple tank comprising tracks, body, turret, and barrel.
* Textures: Later on, add for visual flare.
* Music: Background music to create tension.
